Enviro-Bank runs only 2 types of accounts, namely, a savings account, and a current account. The functionality for these 2 types of accounts must be implemented in 2 different classes:
SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount. Note that despite the similarityin some of their functionality, in the real world, there is also lot of functionality between these 2 accounts that are different.
The project is only focuses the “withdraw” functionality.
